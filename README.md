This repo is a simple communication library for Arduino and Android with using Usb Shield.
Project also contains an example.With this library you can achieve :

	*Connect an Arduino to Android with usb cable as accessory.
	*With accessory support on android you can get higher baud rates.
	*Set commands and define a function to answer these commands.
	
This project is created on Xcode with using embedXcode.
For info about how to install embedXcode(https://arduandro.wordpress.com/2015/10/02/a-better-development-environment-for-arduino-embedxcode/)
You can upload directly an Arduino uno and test library with this apk:https://www.dropbox.com/s/o27bp8mgnwplbwz/ADKLibraryCom.apk?dl=0
It sends "getBV" with clicking message button and Arduino answers it.

This repo is a simple communication library for Arduino and Android with using Usb Shield.
Project also contains an example.With this library you can achieve :\n\r*Connect an Arduino to Android with usb cable as accessory.\n\r*With accessory support on android you can get higher baud rates.\n\r*Set commands and define a function to answer these commands.\n This project is created on Xcode with using embedXcode.\n For info about how to install embedXcode(https://arduandro.wordpress.com/2015/10/02/a-better-development-environment-for-arduino-embedxcode/)\nYou can upload directly an Arduino uno and test library with this apk:https://www.dropbox.com/s/o27bp8mgnwplbwz/ADKLibraryCom.apk?dl=0\nIt sends "getBV" with clicking message button and Arduino answers it.
